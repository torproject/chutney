This is chutney.  It doesn't do much so far.  It isn't ready for prime-time.

If it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces.

It is supposed to be a good tool for:
  - Configuring a testing tor network
  - Launching and monitoring a testing tor network
  - Running tests on a testing tor network

Right now it only sorta does these things.

You will need, at the moment:
  - Tor installed somewhere in your path or the location of the 'tor' and
    'tor-gencert' binaries specified through the environment variables
    CHUTNEY_TOR and CHUTNEY_TOR_GENCERT, respectively.
  - Python 2.7 or later

Stuff to try:

Standard Actions:
  ./chutney configure networks/basic
  ./chutney start networks/basic
  ./chutney status networks/basic
  ./chutney verify networks/basic
  ./chutney hup networks/basic
  ./chutney stop networks/basic

Bandwidth Tests:
  ./chutney configure networks/basic-min
  ./chutney start networks/basic-min
  ./chutney status networks/basic-min
  CHUTNEY_DATA_BYTES=104857600 ./chutney verify networks/basic-min
  # Send 100MB of data per client connection
  # verify produces performance figures for:
  # Single Stream Bandwidth: the speed of the slowest stream, end-to-end
  # Overall tor Bandwidth: the sum of the bandwidth across each tor instance
  # This approximates the CPU-bound tor performance on the current machine,
  # assuming everything is multithreaded and network performance is infinite.
  ./chutney stop networks/basic-min

Connection Tests:
  ./chutney configure networks/basic-025
  ./chutney start networks/basic-025
  ./chutney status networks/basic-025
  CHUTNEY_CONNECTIONS=5 ./chutney verify networks/basic-025
  # Make 5 connections from each client through a random exit
  ./chutney stop networks/basic-025

Note: If you create 7 or more connections to a hidden service from a single
client, you'll likely get a verification failure due to
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/15937

HS Connection Tests:
  ./chutney configure networks/hs-025
  ./chutney start networks/hs-025
  ./chutney status networks/hs-025
  CHUTNEY_HS_MULTI_CLIENT=1 ./chutney verify networks/hs-025
  # Make a connection from each client to each hs
  # Default behavior is one client connects to each HS
  ./chutney stop networks/hs-025

The configuration files:
  networks/basic holds the configuration for the network you're configuring
  above.  It refers to some torrc template files in torrc_templates/.

The working files:
  chutney sticks its working files, including all data directories, log
  files, etc, in ./net/.  Each tor instance gets a subdirectory of net/nodes.

  You can override the directory "./net" with the CHUTNEY_DATA_DIR
  environment variable.

Test scripts:
  The test scripts are stored in the "scripts/chutney_tests" directory. These
  Python files must define a "run_test(network)" function. Files starting with
  an underscore ("_") are ignored.
